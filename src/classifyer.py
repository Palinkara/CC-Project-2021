# In this file, the classifyer trained in neuralNetwork.py will be used to distinguish 
# between different event types.
# The Event planner unknowingly starts the process of feeding the classifyer a list of events,
# which it will classify, count and list in an easy-to-understand representation.
# In milestone two this list will be extended by a listing of each event classified 
# under a certain event type.
