# CC-Project-2021
This is a project for the module "Cloud Computing".

## What is the goal of this project?
In the module "Cloud Computing" students are supposed to learn how to cloud compute by working on their own project. The goal of this specific project is to create an application for organisations which plan to provide their members with events, but have no idea which events might be popular.
To do this an application will be created in which the members are able to note down their private events and parties. By doing this the organisation is later able to evaluate the noted events by using a Wordvector-trained system and therefore to see which eventtypes (types! "Movies/Series" is a type - "Captain America" is not. Same for "Music" and "Panic! At the disco-concert".) are popular with their members.
Based on that events can be organised which will leave all parties involved satisfied.
